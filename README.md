📊Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning
📌Overview

Customer churn is a major challenge for businesses, especially subscription-based services. This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning by analyzing key business features such as tenure, contract type, internet service, payment method, and monthly charges.

The solution helps businesses identify at-risk customers ahead of time and apply targeted retention strategies to reduce churn and increase customer loyalty.

🎯Objectives

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand churn trends.
- Visualize customer behavior using graphs and statistical plots.
- Preprocess and prepare data for machine learning.
- Build a Random Forest Classifier to predict customer churn.
- Evaluate the model using multiple performance metrics.

🔍Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualizations

Churn Distribution – Pie Chart
Internet Service, Contract Type, Payment Method – Bar Plots
Customer Tenure Analysis – Histogram
Numerical Feature Analysis – Box Plot by Churn
Correlation Heatmap – Feature Relationships

These insights helped identify key churn drivers:
📌Month-to-month contracts
📌Electronic check payment method
📌High monthly charges
📌Shorter tenure

⚙️Model Development

- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)
- Train-test data split
- Model training using Random Forest Classifier
- Hyperparameter tuning (optional)
- Model saving with joblib (optional)
