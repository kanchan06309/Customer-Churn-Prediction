# Customer Churn Prediction
The goal of this project is to develop a classification model that predicts whether a customer will churn. Using demographic data (such as gender, senior citizen status, and tenure) and information about the services they use (such as internet service, phone service, and online security), the model will identify customers at high risk of churning.
